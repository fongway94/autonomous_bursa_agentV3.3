Regression: the watchdog wasn't spawning in several real-world
Streamlit Cloud code paths because `_start_watchdog()` was only called
from ONE place — the end of a successful `start()`. These paths all
skipped it:

  1. `start()` short-circuits via ADOPT_THREAD when a previously-spawned
     scheduler thread is still alive but our local _THREAD handle was
     lost. The user reported seeing ADOPT_THREAD events in their live
     scheduler log but ZERO WATCHDOG_STARTED events — proof this path
     was being hit in production.

  2. `start()` returns False with START_REJECT when the local _THREAD is
     alive (most common normal-running case after the first successful
     start).

  3. `ensure_started()` Case 2 returns early when the scheduler is
     healthy and we own it — never calls start(), so the watchdog never
     spawns. This is the path Streamlit Cloud takes on EVERY rerun
     after the initial boot, so if the watchdog wasn't spawned on the
     very first start, it never spawns at all.

  4. If the watchdog thread itself died (uncaught exception, memory
     pressure, etc.), nothing respawned it because `_start_watchdog`'s
     "skip if already alive" check is correct in isolation but had no
     liveness-driven respawn caller.

Fix: introduce `_ensure_watchdog_running(my_pid)` — idempotent, safe to
call from every path that "knows the scheduler is in good shape".
Wired into:
  - `start()` end (already there)
  - `start()` ADOPT_THREAD path (new)
  - `ensure_started()` Case 2 (new — most important for Streamlit Cloud)

Together these guarantee the watchdog is alive whenever the scheduler
loop is alive, regardless of how the process got there.
