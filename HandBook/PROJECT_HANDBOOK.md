## 1. Project Mission & Core Objective

**Mission:** Autonomous AI agent that paper-trades Bursa Malaysia swing setups, learns from outcomes over multiple years, and (eventually) sends real-broker entry/exit alerts to a human trader for manual mirroring.

**Core principles:**
- **Honest learning** — Bayesian posteriors, not fake RL theater. Statistically sound on small samples.
- **Defensive by design** — risk gates always fire. Drawdown circuit breakers protect capital.
- **Fully auditable** — every state change leaves a row in a log table.
- **Real Bursa mechanics** — 100-share lots, 0.15% fees, volume-aware slippage, real session hours, public holidays.
- **Durable memory** — the brain persists indefinitely via Gist backup, surviving every container reset.
- **Self-healing scheduler** — orphan-thread registry + runaway-cycle watchdog ensure the loop can't get permanently stuck (v3.1.10).
- **Light theme only** — enforced by both Streamlit config and CSS override.
- **Defaults err on safety** — 1% risk/trade, auto-trade ON but with conservative thresholds.

Communication between modules happens via **SQLite**, not in-memory objects. This means scheduler thread + UI re-renders never deadlock or share mutable state.

The Gist backup runs out-of-band — never blocking trade execution, always degrading silently if GitHub is unreachable.

The scheduler now spawns **two** daemon threads at start: the cycle loop (`bursa-scheduler`) and the runaway-cycle watchdog (`bursa-watchdog`). The watchdog runs every 60 s and forces a clean handoff if any cycle exceeds 10 minutes (v3.1.10).

## 4. Key Design Decisions

Every decision below has a deliberate rationale. Don't change them without understanding why.

### 4.1 Bayesian Beta posteriors, not Q-learning
- The original v1 had "Q-learning" that was actually just an EMA of immediate rewards — no next-state bootstrapping, statistically wrong.
- Swing trading on ~80 tickers gives 5-20 trades per state at maturity. That's tiny-sample territory.
- **Bayesian Beta(α,β) is the correct tool.** Lower confidence bound for action selection during EXPLOIT mode; Thompson sampling during EXPLORE mode.
- Auto-switches EXPLORE → EXPLOIT at 50 closed trades.

### 4.2 SQLite over JSON files
- v1 had file-lock race conditions in the scheduler thread.
- SQLite WAL mode handles 1000+ concurrent writes/sec with zero errors (proven by stress test).
- Single `bursa_agent.db` file at `~/.bursa_agent_data/`.
- ACID transactions for every state change.

### 4.3 PID-based scheduler ownership
- Streamlit Cloud auto-redeploys on every push. Ghost threads from previous deploys can survive briefly.
- Each scheduler thread stamps its PID into `scheduler_state.owner_pid`.
- Every loop iteration checks if current owner matches its own PID. If not, ghost exits cleanly.
- Combined with `maintenance_state` table for SQL-CAS idempotency on daily tasks.

### 4.4 Boot debounce — no scan on startup (v3.1.3)
- Every Streamlit Cloud redeploy spawns a fresh scheduler thread.
- Without debounce, every GitHub push during market hours triggered an immediate market scan → wasteful yfinance hits, confusing logs.
- The loop now **sleeps until the next scheduled boundary** before its first cycle.
- User can still force an instant scan via the "⚡ Run Cycle Now" button or "🔥 SCAN MARKET" button — both bypass the debounce.

### 4.5 Auto-trade ON by default
- User explicitly chose this. Default is `autotrade_enabled=1`.
- Auto-exit is also ON by default (defensive).
- User can toggle either independently in the 🤖 Robo-Trader tab.

### 4.6 1% default max_risk_per_trade_pct
- Lowered from v2's 2% because auto-trade ON means agent acts without supervision.
- User-adjustable in Settings → Risk Parameters.
- Drawdown warns at 8%, hard-stops at 15%.

### 4.7 Asymmetric risk multipliers by regime
- BULL → 60% confidence threshold, 8 max positions, 14-day max hold
- NEUTRAL → 70% threshold, 5 positions, 7-day hold
- BEAR → 80% threshold, 3 positions, 5-day hold, 50% position sizing, +40% confidence penalty
- **Doing fewer trades in BEAR is correct behaviour.** Don't loosen these.

### 4.8 Volume-aware slippage
- Base 5 bps + size-linear + liquidity penalty up to 80 bps cap.
- Reads avg daily traded value from scan cache.
- Realistic for Bursa small caps (RM 0.30-4.00 universe).

### 4.9 100-share lot enforcement
- Bursa trades in board lots of 100. The engine auto-rounds down.
- 137-share order becomes 100 (not 137).

### 4.10 Bursa-native market calendar (v3.1.2)
- Real sessions: PRE_OPEN_AM (08:30-09:00), MORNING (09:00-12:30), LUNCH (12:30-14:00), PRE_OPEN_PM (14:00-14:30), AFTERNOON (14:30-16:45), PRE_CLOSE (16:45-16:50), TRADING_AT_LAST (16:50-17:00).
- Lunch break and pre-open phases correctly treated as "no fills".
- Public holidays hardcoded through 2027 in `market_calendar.MY_PUBLIC_HOLIDAYS`.
- Safe-entry window cutoff at 16:00 for new auto-entries (gives trades ≥1h to develop).

### 4.11 Light theme locked
- `.streamlit/config.toml` + inline CSS override.
- User requirement; do not change.

### 4.12 Notification-only mode for live trading (v3.1)
- Real broker orders are NOT placed. The system sends Telegram + email alerts.
- User manually mirrors trades in Moomoo.
- `broker_adapter.py` has a Moomoo stub ready for v4 when user wants direct API execution.

### 4.13 Daily maintenance idempotency (v3.1.1)
- ML classifier nightly retrain was firing 8× per night due to ghost threads.
- `maintenance_state` table + `try_claim_daily_task()` use SQL `INSERT OR IGNORE` for atomic CAS.
- Only one process per MYT date can win each daily task — proven by 20-thread concurrency test.

### 4.14 Regime trend tracking (v3.1.4)
- `regime_history` table records (regime, conviction, KLCI 200-EMA distance) on every cycle.
- `get_regime_trend()` exposes a 24-hour rolling summary (WEAKENING / STRENGTHENING / STABLE).
- Used by cycle-explanation messages so "0 entries fired" tells you whether BEAR is easing (entries may resume soon) or deepening (stay defensive).

### 4.15 Persistent backup via GitHub Gist (v3.1.5) ⭐
- **This is critical to the project's core value proposition.** Without it, every Streamlit Cloud container reset (GitHub push, manual reboot, 7-day sleep, platform maintenance) would wipe the entire database including the Bayesian brain. The "self-learning over time" promise would collapse.
- `persistence.py` backs up the full SQLite DB (gzip + base64) to a single private GitHub Gist.
- Triggered on: every closed trade (instant brain preservation), hourly heartbeat (safety net), every full exit (manual or auto).
- On boot, `boot_restore_once()` checks if local DB is empty and restores from the latest gist.
- Rate-limited to 30s minimum between backups (prevents API hammering).
- Requires user to set `GITHUB_TOKEN` (classic PAT with `gist` scope only) in Streamlit Secrets.
- **Without this token, all data is volatile.** The Settings tab shows a prominent warning if not configured.
- All backup operations wrapped in try/except — never block trade execution. Failure degrades silently to "agent still works, data still ephemeral until token is set."

### 4.16 Conservative duplicate-loop guards + silent ghost exit (v3.1.8)
- Streamlit reruns the script on every interaction. Daemon threads usually survive but module-level handles can be lost on reload.
- Before v3.1.8 each rerun could spawn a fresh scheduler thread that logged HEARTBEAT/SKIP before realizing it was a ghost — produced "10 SKIPs in 16 seconds" log spam.
- Fix: `_loop` checks `owner_pid` FIRST. If another live owner exists (heartbeat < 5 min old), exit SILENTLY — no work, no log spam (one breadcrumb GHOST_EXIT row max per process).
- `ensure_started()` is conservative: if another live owner is detected, do nothing. Adopt rather than duplicate alive threads when our local handle is lost.

### 4.17 Crash + handle-loss recovery (v3.1.9)
- Earlier guards could permanently block `start()` if the local `_THREAD` handle was lost while DB still showed a fresh heartbeat (e.g. Streamlit script reload race).
- Guards 2 and 3 now only block when there is a *local* alive thread. If the thread crashed silently, the stale DB state is ignored and start() proceeds.
- `_run_one_cycle` accepts `my_pid` so it can abort if ownership changed mid-cycle.
- `_STOP_EVENT.clear()` moved to AFTER all guards pass — previously a slow-dying thread saw the event cleared and slept for up to an hour instead of exiting.

### 4.18 Zombie thread recovery — orphan registry (v3.1.10) ⭐
- **Problem class:** a `_loop` cycle gets stuck inside a long network call (yfinance hang) or sleeps past `stop()`'s 5-second join window. The thread survives stop. On the next Start click, `start()`'s Guard 2 enumerates threads, finds the still-alive zombie named `bursa-scheduler`, ADOPTS it (since the local handle was cleared), and returns False — leaving the UI permanently on "🔴 STOPPED" with no path back to RUNNING.
- Reproduced live in the screenshot that prompted v3.1.10: heartbeat stuck at 17:00, last cycle at 12:00, Start/Force-Restart/Kill-Switch all did nothing.
- **Fix:** module-level `_ORPHANED_THREAD_IDS: set[int]`. `stop()` records `_THREAD.ident` here BEFORE the bounded join — so even if the thread is stuck, the orphan flag still applies. `start()` Guard 2 SKIPS any `bursa-scheduler` thread whose ident is in this set. The orphan still self-terminates via the existing `owner_pid` mismatch check inside `_loop` — no thread leak.
- `force_restart()` no longer blocks for 30 seconds polling for the zombie to die — useless if the thread is hung. The orphan flag does the work.
- The set is garbage-collected at the top of each `start()` so dead idents don't accumulate.
- **Tests:** `test_zombie_thread_recovery.py` (3 tests including the exact production scenario).

### 4.19 Runaway-cycle watchdog (v3.1.10) ⭐
- **Problem class:** the v3.1.10 orphan fix lets the *user* recover the UI by clicking Start. But what if no one is watching (overnight, weekend)? A single stuck cycle would still mean hours of no scans.
- **Fix:** separate `bursa-watchdog` daemon thread spawned by `start()`. Reads `scheduler_state.cycle_started_at` (new column) every 60 s. If a cycle has been running > `WATCHDOG_CYCLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default 600 = 10 min), the watchdog (1) logs `CYCLE_TIMEOUT`, (2) clears `cycle_started_at`, (3) bumps `owner_pid` to a sentinel value (-1), (4) marks the stuck thread as orphaned.
- The stuck `_loop` self-exits on its next wake via the existing `owner_pid` mismatch check. Next Streamlit rerun → `ensure_started()` spawns a fresh loop.
- **Soft warn:** any cycle exceeding `CYCLE_DURATION_WARN_SEC` (default 300 = 5 min) logs `CYCLE_SLOW` even if it completes. Early visibility before the watchdog has to act.
- **Critical caveat:** Python `threading` cannot interrupt blocking I/O. The watchdog cannot make the stuck cycle return faster — it only ensures the system *recovers* within 10 min instead of forever. That's why **every external call must have its own timeout**. Audited and confirmed: yfinance (15-30 s), requests (30-60 s), smtp (configurable).
- **Single source of truth:** only the owner_pid process's watchdog acts on its own cycle. Cross-process false positives are impossible.
- **Tests:** `test_watchdog_and_cycle_tracking.py` (8 tests).

### Scheduler invariants (v3.1.10)

The scheduler module guarantees:
1. **At most one** `bursa-scheduler` thread per process is treated as "live and authoritative". Zombies in the orphan registry are excluded from this count.
2. **At most one** `bursa-watchdog` thread per process.
3. `is_running()` is True ↔ a non-orphaned alive thread exists AND `scheduler_state.running = 1`. (False on either side means the badge is honest.)
4. The UI can ALWAYS recover from STOPPED → RUNNING via the Start button. If it can't, that's a P0 bug.
5. A runaway cycle is autonomously evicted within `WATCHDOG_CYCLE_TIMEOUT_SEC + WATCHDOG_TICK_SEC` (≤ 11 min by default).

## 7. The Robo-Trader Lifecycle

### Startup sequence (every Streamlit redeploy)

```
1. Streamlit Cloud kills old process, spawns new one
2. app.py imports trigger db.init_db() (creates/migrates schema,
   incl. cycle_started_at column v3.1.10)
3. boot_restore_once() runs — if local DB is empty AND GITHUB_TOKEN set,
   restore from Gist (preserves brain across resets)
4. app.py calls sched.ensure_started() — spawns daemon thread
5. Thread immediately writes STARTED log with PID
6. start() also spawns the bursa-watchdog thread (v3.1.10)
7. Thread sleeps until next scheduled boundary (v3.1.3 DEBOUNCE)
   → prevents instant scan on redeploy
8. First real cycle runs at the next top-of-hour
```

### Wake-up sequence (every hour, after debounce)

```
1. HEARTBEAT logged (+update last_heartbeat, next_run_at, owner_pid)
2. Hourly persistence backup fires (v3.1.5, rate-limited)
3. Check kill_switch — if engaged, exit loop
4. Check owner_pid — if changed (incl. WATCHDOG sentinel -1), exit silently
5. Check market hours via market_calendar.is_market_open()
     - if closed → log SKIP with reason + next event time, sleep
6. If open:
     a. Stamp cycle_started_at = now (v3.1.10, watchdog hook)
     b. Run _run_one_cycle()
        i.   Fetch fresh KLCI regime
        ii.  Record regime snapshot to regime_history (v3.1.4)
        iii. Scan all ~80 tickers (parallel yfinance pulls, timeout=15s each)
        iv.  Validate data via data_quality
        v.   Cache results in scan_cache table
        vi.  AUTO-SETTLE if autoexit_enabled:
             - Check active trades against SL/TP/trailing/time exits
             - Close any that hit
             - Feed each closed trade to learner.learn_from_trade_outcome()
             - Trigger persistence.backup() if any trade closed (v3.1.5)
        vii. AUTO-ENTRY if autotrade_enabled AND in safe-entry window:
             - Filter scan → GOLD BUY ≥ regime threshold
             - For each: run_full_risk_check → execute_entry (if pass)
             - Log AUTO_ENTRY_END with reason if zero entries fired
               (v3.1.2 includes regime trend if BEAR + below-threshold)
     c. Clear cycle_started_at = NULL (v3.1.10, in finally block)
     d. If duration > 5 min: log CYCLE_SLOW (soft warn)
7. Daily maintenance (only at 01:00-01:05 MYT, only one process wins via try_claim_daily_task):
     - prune_logs (keep last 5000 rows per log table)
     - train_setup_classifier (nightly ML retrain)
     - exploration_mode auto-disable if ≥ target trades
8. Update last_run_at, next_run_at = top of next hour
9. Sleep until next wake-up (interruptible by stop event)
```

### Watchdog sequence (every 60 s, in parallel)

```
1. Read scheduler_state. Is cycle_started_at set?
2. Is owner_pid still our PID? (If not, skip — another process is in charge.)
3. Compute age = now - cycle_started_at.
4. If age > 600 s:
     a. Log CYCLE_TIMEOUT (ERROR level)
     b. Clear cycle_started_at, set running=0, set owner_pid=-1 (sentinel),
        set last_error with stuck duration
     c. Add the stuck scheduler thread's ident to _ORPHANED_THREAD_IDS
5. Sleep 60 s (interruptible by _WATCHDOG_STOP_EVENT)
```

### Safe-entry window (v3.1.2)

| Time MYT | Auto-exits | New entries |
|---|---|---|
| 08:30–09:00 (PRE_OPEN_AM) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **09:00–12:30 (MORNING)** | **✅** | **✅** |
| 12:30–14:00 (LUNCH_BREAK) | ❌ | ❌ |
| 14:00–14:30 (PRE_OPEN_PM) | ❌ | ❌ |
| **14:30–16:00 (AFTERNOON early)** | **✅** | **✅** |
| 16:00–16:45 (AFTERNOON late) | ✅ | ❌ (too late, <1h to develop) |
| 16:45–17:00 (PRE_CLOSE + TaL) | ✅ | ❌ |
| 17:00 onwards | ❌ | ❌ |
| Weekends + 50+ public holidays | ❌ | ❌ |

## 8. The Self-Learning Engine

### What evolves automatically

| Layer | Updates | When | Auto? | Persisted? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bayesian state priors (α, β) | Every closed trade | Instant | ✅ | ✅ Gist |
| Strategy biases (breakout_bias, pullback_bias) | Every closed trade with that strategy | Instant | ✅ | ✅ Gist |
| Sector biases | Every closed trade in that sector | Instant | ✅ | ✅ Gist |
| ML setup classifier (calibrated GBM) | All historical data | Nightly at 01:00 MYT | ✅ | ⚠️ .pkl file NOT in Gist; rebuilds nightly |
| Scanner parameters (EMA/RSI/ATR) | Walk-forward optimization | User clicks button | ⚠️ Manual | ✅ Gist (in `parameters` table) |
| Regime history (conviction trend) | Every cycle | Instant | ✅ | ✅ Gist |

### The two-phase learning cycle

**Phase 1 — EXPLORATION (first 50 closed trades)**
- Thompson sampling from each (state, action) Beta posterior
- Optimistic Beta(2,1) prior on BUY for unseen states
- Smaller shrinkage toward 50% prior (0.25× vs 0.5×)
- Agent tries setups quickly to populate the brain

**Phase 2 — EXPLOITATION (after 50 trades, auto-switch)**
- Lower confidence bound (LCB) for action selection
- Conservative: only acts on setups with statistical evidence
- Standard shrinkage (0.5× toward 50%)

### Reward function

```python
WIN  → α += min(max(|pnl_pct|/5, 0.5), 3.0)
LOSS → β += min(max(|pnl_pct|/5, 0.5), 3.0)
BREAKEVEN → β += 0.25 (small opportunity-cost penalty)
```

R-multiple per trade = `realized_pnl / (risk_per_share × shares)`

### Bias shrinkage formula

```python
# Beta(5,5) prior — equivalent to 10 imaginary trades, prevents whipsaws
wr_shrunk = (wins + 5) / (total_trades + 10)
breakout_bias = clip(wr_shrunk / 0.5, 0.75, 1.30)
```

## 9. Operational Runbooks

### A. How to adjust max risk per trade
1. ⚙️ Settings tab → Risk Parameters
2. Change "Max risk / trade %" value
3. Click 💾 Save Risk Parameters
4. Logged automatically in `parameter_history`

### B. How to turn auto-entry OFF (manual approval mode)
1. 🤖 Robo-Trader tab → Auto-Trading Toggles
2. Uncheck "Auto-execute new GOLD BUY entries"
3. Click 💾 Save Robo-Trader settings
4. Scheduler force-restarts automatically

### C. Emergency stop everything
1. 🤖 Robo-Trader tab → 🚨 Kill-Switch (red button)
2. Loop exits within 60 seconds; will NOT auto-restart
3. To re-enable: ⚙️ Settings → Kill-Switch section → Clear

### D. Reset capital and trades
1. ⚙️ Settings → ⚠️ Destructive actions expander
2. Click "⛔ Delete all trades + scan cache"
3. State priors persist (preserved learning)
4. For full brain wipe: stop app, delete `~/.bursa_agent_data/bursa_agent.db`, restart

### E. Set up Telegram alerts
1. Create bot via @BotFather, get token
2. Get chat ID via @userinfobot
3. Send `/start` to your new bot
4. Streamlit Cloud → Manage app → Secrets:
   ```
   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "..."
   TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID = "..."
   ```
5. 🔔 Live Alerts tab → check "Send to Telegram" → Save → Test alert button

### F. Set up Email alerts (Gmail)
1. Enable 2-Step Verification on Google account
2. Generate App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Streamlit Cloud → Secrets:
   ```
   ALERT_SMTP_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
   ALERT_SMTP_PORT = "587"
   ALERT_SMTP_USER = "you@gmail.com"
   ALERT_SMTP_PASSWORD = "<app password, no spaces>"
   ALERT_SMTP_FROM = "you@gmail.com"
   ```
4. 🔔 Live Alerts tab → check "Send to Email" → fill recipients → Save → Test

### G. Set up persistent backup (CRITICAL for long-term operation)
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens **(NOT `?type=beta`)**
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Note: `bursa-ai-backup`
4. Expiration: 1 year (or longer)
5. **Select only the `gist` scope** (don't check anything else)
6. Generate → copy the token (starts with `ghp_...`)
7. Streamlit Cloud → Manage app → Secrets:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_..."
   ```
8. Restart app → ⚙️ Settings tab → 🗄️ Persistent Backup section
9. Click "💾 Backup now" → verify success message + new gist appears at https://gist.github.com/{your-username}
10. From now on, all data persists across container resets

**Important:** Fine-grained tokens (`?type=beta`) do NOT support the Gist API. You must use classic tokens.

### H. Verify the agent is running
1. Sidebar shows 🤖 Robo-Trader 🟢 RUNNING with current heartbeat
2. 🤖 Robo-Trader tab → check last_run_at within 1 hour
3. 📜 Logs → Robo-Trader scheduler → see hourly HEARTBEAT events
4. **v3.1.10:** also look for `WATCHDOG_STARTED` once per session, and absence of `CYCLE_TIMEOUT` events. A `CYCLE_SLOW` event is informational (cycle was slow but completed).

### I. Diagnose "zero auto-entries"
The system self-explains in the AUTO_ENTRY_END log message. Common reasons:
- BEAR regime + no signal ≥ 80% confidence (message now includes regime trend — see v3.1.4)
- At max concurrent positions
- All qualifiers already held
- Outside safe-entry window
- Auto-entry toggle is OFF
- yfinance outage (data quality log will show errors)

### J. Detect and fix ghost threads
- 🤖 Robo-Trader tab auto-shows a 🧟 banner if old + new heartbeat formats coexist
- Fix: Streamlit Cloud → Manage app → ⋮ → Reboot app

### K. Force an immediate scan (without waiting for hourly cycle)
After v3.1.3 debounce, the scheduler waits until the next top-of-hour after startup. To scan immediately:
- **🤖 Robo-Trader tab → ⚡ Run Cycle Now** — full scan + settle + auto-entry
- **🔍 Scanner tab → 🔥 SCAN MARKET** — scan only (no auto-entry)

### L. Restore from backup after disaster
If your data appears wiped (DB shows 0 trades, brain reset):
1. ⚙️ Settings tab → 🗄️ Persistent Backup
2. Click "♻️ Restore from latest backup"
3. Confirm the warning prompt
4. App restarts with full data restored

### M. Run tests locally before pushing changes
```bash
cd <project_root>
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest tests/ -q
# Expect: 168 passed in ~30 seconds (v3.1.10)
```

### N. Renew the public holiday calendar (every January)

The agent uses `market_calendar.MY_PUBLIC_HOLIDAYS` to skip trading on
Bursa Malaysia holidays. This set must be extended yearly. The system
shows a maintenance reminder banner from October each year, and an
OVERDUE banner if January arrives without the new year's holidays.

**When the banner appears:**

1. Go to the **official Bursa Malaysia Trading Holidays page**:
   https://www.bursamalaysia.com/trade/our_products_services/equities/trading_holidays
   (typically updated late November / early December)
2. Open `market_calendar.py` in your GitHub repo
3. Find the `MY_PUBLIC_HOLIDAYS` set (around line 100)
4. Add the new year's block following the existing comment style:
   ```python
       # ---- YYYY ----
       "YYYY-01-01",  # New Year's Day
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Chinese New Year (verify exact date — lunar calendar)
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Chinese New Year (day 2)
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Thaipusam
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Nuzul Al-Quran
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Hari Raya Aidilfitri
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Hari Raya Aidilfitri (day 2)
       "YYYY-05-01",  # Labour Day
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Wesak Day
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Yang di-Pertuan Agong's Birthday
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Hari Raya Aidiladha
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Awal Muharram
       "YYYY-08-31",  # National Day
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Maulidur Rasul
       "YYYY-09-16",  # Malaysia Day
       "YYYY-MM-DD",  # Deepavali
       "YYYY-12-25",  # Christmas Day
   ```
5. Push to GitHub — Streamlit Cloud auto-redeploys
6. Verify the banner disappears + check **⚙️ Settings → 🗓️ Long-Term Maintenance Status**
7. Should now show: **"✅ Public holiday list — current year covered"**

**Critical:** Lunar/Islamic dates (Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Thaipusam,
Deepavali, Wesak, Aidiladha, Awal Muharram, Maulidur Rasul) shift each
year. Don't guess — use Bursa's published dates. Fixed dates are only
New Year (Jan 1), Labour Day (May 1), National Day (Aug 31), Malaysia
Day (Sep 16), Christmas (Dec 25).

### O. Renew the GitHub Personal Access Token (every ~12 months)

The Gist backup requires a GitHub PAT in Streamlit Cloud Secrets. Tokens
expire (typically 1 year). When they do, backups silently fail.

The system warns automatically:
- **At 11 months** — yellow banner (give yourself buffer time)
- **At 12+ months** — red banner with "I rotated the token" button

**Steps when the banner appears:**

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens **(NOT `?type=beta` — classic only)**
2. Either:
   - Click **"Regenerate"** on the existing `bursa-ai-backup` token, OR
   - Delete the old one + click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Set:
   - **Note:** `bursa-ai-backup` (or include the year, e.g. `bursa-ai-backup-2027`)
   - **Expiration:** 1 year
   - **Scope:** check ONLY ☑ **`gist`**
4. **Copy the new token** immediately (starts with `ghp_...`) — you only see it once
5. Streamlit Cloud → your app → **Manage app** → **Secrets**
6. Replace the `GITHUB_TOKEN` value:
   ```
   GITHUB_TOKEN = "ghp_NEW_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```
7. Save (Streamlit auto-restarts within ~30s)
8. Open the app
9. If the red overdue banner is showing → click **"✅ I rotated the token"**
   - This resets the 11-month timer internally
   - Banner disappears
10. Verify: **⚙️ Settings → 🗄️ Persistent Backup → click 💾 Backup now**
    - Should succeed with new gist revision
    - Token reset confirmed

**If you missed the renewal window and backups have been failing:**

The agent continues running normally — trades, brain, learning all happen
in the local SQLite DB. The only risk is if a Streamlit Cloud container
reset (push, reboot, 7-day sleep) happens before you renew the token,
the data accumulated since the last successful backup is lost.

So: when the banner appears, treat it as a high-priority task. The fix
is 5 minutes; the cost of ignoring it can be weeks of lost brain learning.

### P. Diagnose a stuck scheduler (v3.1.10)

**Symptoms:**
- 🤖 Robo-Trader status badge stays 🔴 STOPPED even after clicking Start
- Heartbeat is older than 5 minutes
- `last_run_at` hasn't advanced
- Clicking Start / Force Restart / Kill-Switch + Start does nothing

**Diagnosis order:**

1. **Check the cycle log** — `📜 Logs → Robo-Trader scheduler`. Look for:
   - `CYCLE_TIMEOUT` (ERROR) → the watchdog already detected a stuck cycle. The system should self-recover within the next Streamlit rerun.
   - `CYCLE_SLOW` (WARN) → a recent cycle was slow but completed. Yahoo Finance may be degraded.
   - `START_REJECT` / `ADOPT_THREAD` (INFO) → the duplicate-loop guards are firing. Should NOT prevent recovery in v3.1.10 (the orphan registry handles this).
   - `BACKUP_FAIL` (WARN) → the Gist backup is failing. Check PAT.
2. **Check `last_error`** in the 🤖 Robo-Trader tab — if it mentions "Watchdog forced handoff", that's the v3.1.10 recovery doing its job.
3. **Click ▶️ Start** once. It should succeed even if a zombie thread is alive in the background. If it returns False, file a bug — the v3.1.10 orphan registry should have made this impossible.
4. **If nothing else works** — Streamlit Cloud → Manage app → ⋮ → Reboot app. This kills the entire Python process, eliminating any zombie threads.

| **v3.1.10** | **Two yfinance calls in `evaluation.py` lacked explicit `timeout=` — Performance tab could hang indefinitely on slow Yahoo days** | Defensive fix; covered by general yfinance audit |

---

## 11. Known Gaps & v4 Roadmap

### Known gaps (deliberately deferred)

| Gap | Impact | Why deferred |
|---|---|---|
| Single data source (yfinance) | Agent blind during outages | User explicitly deferred. Secondary source hook in `market_analyzer._try_secondary_klci()` |
| No corporate actions (splits, bonuses) | ~5% of small caps affected/year | Manual JSON workaround possible |
| Slippage model is heuristic | Real fills may differ for very thin stocks | Volume-aware version covers most cases |
| No real broker execution | Notification only | Moomoo adapter stubbed; user wants 6-month validation first |
| Public holiday list expires after 2027 | Must update yearly | Hardcoded in `market_calendar.MY_PUBLIC_HOLIDAYS` |
| GitHub PAT expires | Backups silently fail | User must rotate ~yearly |
| ML classifier .pkl not in Gist | Lost on container reset | Self-rebuilds nightly within 24h, so non-critical |
| Python `threading` cannot interrupt blocking I/O | Watchdog recovers within N min, can't cut a stuck call short | Subprocess-based scan would be a 4× code increase; per-call HTTP timeouts cover the realistic cases |

### v4 candidates (when user is ready)

1. **Moomoo OpenAPI integration** — fill in `broker_adapter.MoomooAdapter` methods, add `broker_mode = "EXECUTE"` toggle in live_trigger.py
2. **Live capital tracking** — separate `live_account` table that records real-broker mirror trades
3. **Calibration-driven auto-mode-switch** — only enable EXECUTE mode if calibration chart shows <5% deviation
4. **GitHub Actions CI** — auto-run pytest on every push
5. **Telegram interactive buttons** — APPROVE/REJECT inline keyboard for each alert
6. **Multi-account support** — track multiple paper accounts with different parameter sets
7. **Rolling-window learning** — fade brain priors older than N months so it adapts to market regime shifts
8. **ML classifier in backup** — include .pkl in Gist so it persists across resets
9. **Multi-revision restore UI** — let user pick which historical backup to restore (currently always latest)
10. **Subprocess-isolated market scan** — run `screen_all_stocks()` in a subprocess with hard `timeout=` so a Yahoo hang can be `SIGKILL`ed (currently we recover within 10 min via watchdog, but the cycle itself still wastes that time)

### Intentional "v4 scaffolding" (kept on purpose, not dead code)

These functions look unused to a casual grep but are deliberate API surface for future features:

| Function | Why kept |
|---|---|
| `broker_adapter.MoomooAdapter.*` (all methods) | v4 stub interface for real broker execution |
| `broker_adapter.get_broker_adapter()` | Factory function for v4 broker selection |
| `learner.get_ml_score()` | For future ML-confidence display in Scanner UI |
| `market_analyzer.get_market_ml_prediction()` | For future regime-prediction panel |
| `repository.get_partial_exits()` | Will surface in trade-detail UI later |
| `risk_manager.validate_stop_loss()` | Helper for future manual SL-edit UI |
| `trading_engine.add_trade_note()`, `tag_trade()` | UI extension hooks for trade annotations |

---

## 12. Conventions for Future Work

When making changes, follow these patterns to keep the system honest and maintainable.

### When fixing a bug
1. Write a failing test FIRST that reproduces the bug
2. Fix the code until the test passes
3. Don't delete the test — it's the regression guard
4. Add a row to the bug table in section 10

### When adding a feature
1. If it touches money/state, add a cash-conservation or invariant test
2. If it adds a config option, surface it in the appropriate tab
3. **If it adds a new SQLite table, ensure it's covered by the Gist backup automatically** (it is — entire DB is backed up)
4. Update `PROJECT_HANDBOOK.md` (this file) section 4 and section 6
5. Update `USER_GUIDE.md` if user-facing
6. **If it makes an external HTTP/network call, it MUST have an explicit `timeout=` kwarg** (v3.1.10 invariant; the watchdog is the safety net, not the first line of defence)

### When changing defaults
1. Update `db.py` schema seed
2. Add a column migration via `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT ...`
3. Update `risk_manager.DEFAULT_RISK_PARAMS` or equivalent
4. Update section 6 of this handbook

### When deleting code (deprecation sweep)
1. Confirm zero imports across the codebase: `grep -rn "name" --include="*.py"`
2. Confirm zero references in tests
3. Delete the code
4. Run `pytest tests/ -q` — all green = safe
5. Verify Streamlit still boots
6. Update section 5 module table if removing a whole module

### When touching the scheduler
1. **Read section 4.16 / 4.17 / 4.18 / 4.19 first.** The duplicate-loop / zombie / watchdog story is non-trivial and has accumulated multiple subtle fixes.
2. The `is_running()` badge MUST be honest — if you change it, also change the tests in `test_zombie_thread_recovery.py`.
3. If you add a new long-running operation inside `_run_one_cycle`, make sure all external I/O has explicit timeouts. The watchdog catches infinite hangs at 10 min but it shouldn't be your first line of defence.
4. Module-level state (`_THREAD`, `_ORPHANED_THREAD_IDS`, `_WATCHDOG_THREAD`) must be reset between tests — see `conftest.py`.

### When debugging on Streamlit Cloud
1. Check 📜 Logs → Robo-Trader scheduler first
2. Look for ERROR-level rows, CYCLE_ERROR, CYCLE_TIMEOUT (v3.1.10), GHOST_EXIT
3. If ghost thread suspected → Streamlit Cloud → Manage app → Reboot app
4. After significant code changes, also reboot to start fresh

### Architectural completeness checks (lesson learned in v3.1.5 + reinforced in v3.1.10)
**Always question your own infrastructure assumptions early.** Before designing any long-running system, ask:
- "Where does the data live, and what kills it?"
- "What's the cost of losing 1 week of operational data?"
- "If I had to recover from total infrastructure loss, how long would it take?"
- "What grows unbounded over the system's life?"
- "What's the longest-running scenario the design has actually been validated for?"
- "If the loop gets stuck, how long before the system recovers without human intervention?" (v3.1.10 lesson)

The v3.1.5 Gist backup should have been part of the v2 design, not a v3.1.5 hotfix. Likewise the v3.1.10 watchdog should have been part of v3.1 — for a system whose value comes from continuous unattended operation, automatic recovery is a core feature, not an ops concern.

### Code style
- Type hints on every public function
- Docstrings explain *why* not *what*
- All SQL via `repository.py` — never raw SQL in business logic
- Wrap external calls (yfinance, Telegram, SMTP, GitHub Gist) in try/except — never crash the scheduler
- **All external calls must have explicit `timeout=` kwargs** (v3.1.10)
- Log every state change to the appropriate audit table

### Testing discipline
- 168 tests, all passing, in ~30 seconds (v3.1.10; was 145 at v3.1.7)
- New features must include tests
- Bug fixes must include regression tests
- **Tests must pass both in isolation AND in the full suite** — `conftest.py` resets scheduler module state between tests (v3.1.10 fix for pre-existing flakiness)
- Run `pytest tests/ -q` before every push to GitHub

## 13. Long-Term Maintenance Calendar

The system is designed to run indefinitely, but a few items need annual attention.
**The agent tells you when each is due** via banners above the dashboard tabs
and in **⚙️ Settings → 🗓️ Long-Term Maintenance Status** (see v3.1.7).

| Task | Frequency | When | Detailed runbook |
|---|---|---|---|
| Append next year's Bursa public holidays to `market_calendar.MY_PUBLIC_HOLIDAYS` | Yearly | Every January (Bursa publishes in late December) | **Section 9.N** |
| Regenerate `GITHUB_TOKEN` and update Streamlit Secrets | Yearly | ~11 months after token creation (system reminds at 11 months) | **Section 9.O** |
| Review walk-forward optimization results and re-run if market regime has fundamentally shifted | Quarterly | Every 3 months (system reminds at 90+ days) | 🧠 AI Learning tab → Run Walk-Forward Optimization |
| Review Performance tab calibration chart and per-regime stats | Monthly | First weekend of each month | 📊 Performance tab |
| Verify Gist backup is still working (check 🗄️ Persistent Backup status in Settings) | Weekly | Open the app — Settings tab | ⚙️ Settings → 🗄️ Persistent Backup |
| Scan for `CYCLE_TIMEOUT` / `CYCLE_SLOW` events in scheduler log (v3.1.10) | Weekly | 📜 Logs tab | If recurring, Yahoo Finance is degraded — investigate or wait it out |

### What you DON'T need to maintain
- The scheduler thread itself (self-healing, watchdog-protected)
- Log table sizes (auto-pruned nightly at 5,000 rows per table)
- The Bayesian brain (auto-evolves with each closed trade)
- ML classifier (retrained nightly)
- Sector / strategy biases (auto-shrunk with Bayesian prior)

### What you SHOULD monitor
- Drawdown level — if it crosses 8% the agent halves position sizes; at 15% all trading pauses
- State priors growth — should keep adding new states as the agent encounters new market conditions
- Calibration chart accuracy — if "80% confidence" picks only win 50%, retune
- **Frequency of CYCLE_TIMEOUT / CYCLE_SLOW events (v3.1.10)** — occasional ones are fine (Yahoo blip); regular ones mean it's time to investigate the data source or add a secondary feed
